# 3.1 One def

- A **device**
- Capable of **sensing**
- Perform some **computations**
- Which translate into **actions** that can **change the outer world**

But that is a vague definition. We can discern:

| **ROBOT**                                | **CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM**                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Perceived as an entity                   | Not necessarily put together, it can be an automated building |
| Physically put together; it has a "body" |                                                               |
