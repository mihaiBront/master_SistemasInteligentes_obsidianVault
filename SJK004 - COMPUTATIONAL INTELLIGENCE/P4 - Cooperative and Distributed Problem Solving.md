# Dichotomy
## Working Together:
- Why and how agents can work together
- It depends on what type of agents are involved
	- Benevolent agents
	- Self-interested agents

## Self-interested agents
- If agents represent individuals or organizations then we can not assume that they are going to show a benevolent behavior. 
- Agents try to reach their self interests, maybe making some kind of competition with each other.
- This can lead to a conflict outcome.
