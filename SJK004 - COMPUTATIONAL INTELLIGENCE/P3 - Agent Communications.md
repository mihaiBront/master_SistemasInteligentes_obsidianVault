We now deal with macro-aspects of intelligent agent technology: those aspects related to the society of agents rather than to the individual agent.

what is cooperation? the prisoner's dilemma, cooperative and non-cooperative encounters; the network of contract

# Computational infrastructure:

- **Communication Protocols** (*PC*): allow exchanging and understanding messages (infrastructure) 
- **Interaction Protocols** (*PI*): establish conversations (structured exchanges of messages) 
- <u>How to create PC and PI</u>?

## Speech acts:

- The main inspiration for the treatment of multiagent communication is based on the speech act theory 
- Speech act theories are pragmatic theories, that is, theories of language usage: they try to determine how people use language to achieve their intentions and goals. 
- The origin of speech record theories can be traced back to Austin's 1962 book How to Do Things with Words.

<b style="color:red">Drawbacks</b>
- too many performative 
- standalone implementation 
- Transport mechanisms not defined 
- Semantics defined in natural language 
- Does not have commissives
