A system of inferences of this kind is properly viewed as a\r theory because such states are not directly observable, and the system can\r be used to make predictions about the behaviour of others. – Premack &\r Woodruff (1978, p. 516)\r Synthetic Nervous System (SNS)\r Design Issues\r Social environment\r Real-time performance\r Establishment of appropriate social expectations\r Self-motivated interaction\r Regulation of interaction\r Readable social Cues\r Interpretation of human’s social cues\r Competent behavior in a complex world\r Believable behavior\r   Basic Computational Unit\r   The process is active when the activation level A exceeds threshold T.\r Levels of behavioral organization\r •  The primitive level is populated with tightly coupled sensorimotor loops. •  The skill level contains modules that coordinate primitives to achieve tasks. •  Behavior level modules deal with questions of relevance, persistence and opportunism in the arbitration of tasks. •  The social level comprises design-time considerations of how the robot’s behaviors will be interpreted and responded to in a social environment.
