Draw the residual plot: We cannot observe any type of structure in the representation. Therefore, we can conclude that the regression model obtained is a good model to explain the relationship between the two variables Hypothesis testing 1. specify the null and alternative hypotheses: Null hypothesis: 𝐻0: 𝛽1 = 0 (the variable 𝑥 is not explanatory) Alternative hypothesis: 𝐻𝑎: 𝛽1 ≠ 0 (the variable 𝑥 is explanatory) 2. set a significance level: 𝛼 = 0.05 Hypothesis testing (cont.) 3. construct a statistic 𝑇 to test the null hypothesis 𝐻0: 𝑆𝐸 𝛽1 = 𝑀𝑆𝐸 σ𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑥𝑖 − ҧ𝑥 2 = Τσ𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖 2 𝑛 − 2 σ𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑥𝑖 − ҧ𝑥 2 = ൗ356.29 10 − 2 476.4 = 0.306 𝑇 = 𝛽1 𝑆𝐸(𝛽1) = 0.979 0.306 = 3.199 4. define a decision rule to reject, or not, the null hypothesis 𝐻0: 𝑃 𝑡𝑛−2 > 𝑇 = 2𝑃 𝑡𝑛−2 > 𝑇 = 2𝑃 𝑡8 > 3.199 = 2 ⋅ 0.0063 = 𝟎. 𝟎𝟏𝟐𝟔 < 𝟎. 𝟎𝟓 Since the p-value is less than 𝜶, we reject the null hypothesis","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
