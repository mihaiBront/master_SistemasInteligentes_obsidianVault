Region proposals 2. Refinement + accurate - speed One-stage Single pass - accurate + speed Average precision (AP) = AUC of precision vs recall Mean AP (mAP) = AP averaged over classes Positive prediction if IoU > 0.5 (negative otherwise) Which are the definitions? YOLO-v8 (2023) Multiple objects of multiple classes can be present. So, what can the output of the network be? Non-maxima suppresion (at inference time) 1. Discard all BB with pcâ‰¤0.6 2. While remaining BBs: a. Choose BB with largest pc b. Discard BB whose IoU with chosen BB (2a) is â‰¥0.5 Repeat independently for each class https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/a-deep-dive-into-non-maximum-suppression-nms-understanding-the-math-behind- object-detection-765ff48392e5 Anchor boxes Two (or more) objects in the same cell! Have a number of predefined anchor boxes (ABs) of different shapes/sizes â€¢ Output vector has as many [pc, bx, by, bw, bh, c1, c2, c3] as ABs At training time, each object is assigned: â€¢ to grid cell as per its midpoint â€¢ to the AB with highest IoU YOLO vs YOLO v2 YOLO v2: â€¢ Anchor Boxes â€¢ Multi-scale training â€¢ Better detection of small objects YOLO v3 vs YOLO v4 YOLO v3: â€¢ \"feature pyramid networks\" (FPN) YOLO v4 â€¢ Anchor boxes from k-means of ground-truth BBs Training datasets YOLO: â€¢ PASCAL VOC (20 categories) YOLO v5 â€¢ D5 (600 categories) Focal loss (YOLOv7) Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection (ICCV 2017) Prevent loss of good classifications (pt>0.5) to dominate Focus on hard misclassifications y is +1 or -1 Transformers vs YOLO DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection (2023) Object detection using YOLO: challenges, architectural successors, datasets and applications (2022) Image-based biometrics: face, iris FaceNet, Triplet loss 2021FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering (CVPR 2015) [CVF, arxiv] [coursera video] Face verification.
