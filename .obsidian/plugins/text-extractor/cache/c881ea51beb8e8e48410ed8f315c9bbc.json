(b) Consider a classifier G, which consists of the following set of discriminant functions: g1(x) = x1 + x2 g2(x) = x2 + 2x3 g3(x) = 3x4 – x3 Run G on Z and give the (guessed) labels of all the objects. For instance, the discriminant functions for object 1 are: g1(x) = x1 + x2 = 5 + 2 = 7 g2(x) = x2 + 2x3 = 2 + 2·1 = 4 g3(x) = 3x4 – x3 = 3·4 – 1 = 11 As max(g1, g2, g3) = g3, then the class label predicted for object 1 is 3. (c) Give the confusion matrix of G and calculate the error of the classifier G. (d) Estimate the prior probabilities for the classes from Z. 2. Consider the classification problem shown in the figure below. The data is depicted as points and the (true) class labels are shown by different markers: class 1 with dots and class 2 with crosses. The object numbers are given next to the markers. Your classifier operates in the following way: for a point x that you want to classify, find the nearest point in Z. Assign x to the class of its nearest neighbour (this is called the nearest neighbour classifier). In the case of a tie, resolve in favour of the class with the lower number (class 1 here). (a) Find the leave-one-out error of the nearest neighbour classifier. (b) Consider the following experiment. Stage1: Objects 1,2,3 and 4 are used for “training” (they form the data set from which we select the nearest neighbour) and objects 5,6 and 7 are used for testing. Stage 2: Objects 1,3,5,7 are used for training and objects 2,4,6 are used for testing. Stage 3: objects 3,4,5 and 6 are used for training and objects 1,2, and 7 are used for testing. The errors on the three testing sets are averaged to obtain an estimate of the error of the classifier. Find this estimate. (c) Which training-testing protocol have we used in (b)?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
