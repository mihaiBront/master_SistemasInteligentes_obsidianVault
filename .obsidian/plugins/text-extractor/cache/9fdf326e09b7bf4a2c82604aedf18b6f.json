Self-interested and autonomous behavioursSolving tasks by cooperationCoordinating actionsWhy write models? Agents? Multiagents? Differential equations of Lotka Volterra model the evolution of the hunters (y) and prey (x): dx/dt = Bx-ùõÉxy dy/dt = ùõÖxy-My Synthesis, analyzing emergent behaviours What will happen if the size of the step of each robot changes? The game of life (rules) If there are 3 live behaviour cells, go live! If there are 0 , 1 or more than 3 live behaviour cells, die! If there are 2 live behaviour cells, stay the same. More emergent behavioursSubject structure (Location: TD1111AL Thursday/TD1110AL Friday) (40% points) Theory classes: - Explanation of theory concepts + exercises (evaluation). - Netlogo development and analysis of models (evaluation). (60% points) Computational solution of problems: - 1 practice with Google colab and Reinforcement Learning. - 2 practices modelling multiagent architectures with message passing in Netlogo. Theory & Practice planification Roughly 13 weeks. ‚óè Unit 1: Modelling an intelligent agent. ‚óè Unit 2: Agent societies. ‚óè Unit 3: Interaction fundamentals. ‚óè Unit 4: Cooperative agents. ‚óè Unit 5: Self-interested agents.
