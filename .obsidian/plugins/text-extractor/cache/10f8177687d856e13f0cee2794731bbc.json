B iology has long been a source of inspiration for engineers mak- ing ever-more capable machines 1. Softness and body compliance are salient features often exploited by biological systems, which tend to seek simplicity and show reduced complexity in their interactions with their environment 2. Several of the lessons learned from studying biological systems are now culminating in the definition of a new class of machine that we, and others, refer to as soft robots 3–6. Conventional, rigid-bodied robots are used extensively in manufacturing and can be specifically programmed to perform a single task efficiently, but often with limited adaptability. Because they are built of rigid links and joints, they are unsafe for interaction with humans. A common practice is to separate human and robotic work spaces in factories to mitigate safety concerns. The lack of compliance in conventional actuation mechanisms is part of this problem. Soft robots provide an opportunity to bridge the gap between machines and people. In contrast to hard-bodied robots, soft robots have bodies made out of intrinsically soft and/or extensible mate- rials (for example, silicone rubbers) that can deform and absorb much of the energy arising from a collision. These robots have a continuously deformable structure with muscle-like actuation that emulates biologi- cal systems and results in a relatively large number of degrees of freedom compared with their hard-bodied counterparts. They (Fig. 1) have the potential to exhibit unprecedented adaptation, sensitivity and agility. Soft robots promise to be able to bend and twist with high curvatures and thus can be used in confined spaces 7; to deform their bodies in a continuous way and thus achieve motions that emulate biology 8; to adapt their shape to the environment, employing compliant motion and thus manipulate objects 9, or move on rough terrain and exhibit resilience 10; or to execute rapid, agile manoeuvres, such as the escape manoeuvre in fish 11. The key challenge for creating soft machines that achieve their full potential is the development of controllable soft bodies using materials that integrate sensors, actuators and computation, and that together ena- ble the body to deliver the desired behaviour. Conventional approaches to robot control assume rigidity in the linkage structure of the robot and are a poor fit for controlling soft bodies, thus soft materials require new algorithms. What is soft? ‘Soft’ refers to the body of the robot. Soft materials are the key ena- blers for creating soft robot bodies. Although Young’s modulus is only defined for homogeneous, prismatic bars that are subject to axial loading and small deformations, it is nonetheless a useful meas- ure of the rigidity of materials used in the fabrication of robotic systems5. Materials conventionally used in robotics (for example, metals or hard plastics) have moduli in the order of 109–1012 pas- cals, whereas natural organisms are often composed of materials (for example, skin or muscle tissue) with moduli in the order of 104–109 Pa (orders of magnitude lower than their engineered coun- terparts; Fig. 2). We define soft robots as systems that are capable of autonomous behaviour, and that are primarily composed of materi- als with moduli in the range of that of soft biological materials. The advantages of using materials with compliance similar to that of soft biological materials include a considerable reduction in the harm that could be inadvertently caused by robotic systems (as has been demonstrated for rigid robots with compliant joints12), increasing their potential for interaction with humans. Compliant materials also adapt more readily to various objects, simplifying tasks such as grasping13, and can also lead to improved mobility over soft substrates14. For the body of a soft robot to achieve its potential, facilities for sensing, actuation, computation, power storage and communication must be embedded in the soft material, resulting in smart materials. In addition, algorithms that drive the body to deliver the desired behaviours are required. These algorithms implement impedance matching to the structure of the body. This tight coupling between body and brain allows us to think about soft-bodied systems as machines with mechanical intelligence, in which the body can be viewed as augmenting the brain with morphological computa- tion15,16. This ability of the body to perform computation simplifies the control algorithms in many situations, blurring the line between the body and the brain. However, soft robots (like soft organisms) require control algorithms, which (at least for the foreseeable future) will run on some sort of computing hardware. Although both body and brain must be considered in concert, the challenges involved are distinct enough that, in this Review, we find it useful to organize them into separate sections. In the following three sections we review recent developments in the field of soft robotics as they pertain to design and fabrication, computation and control, and systems and applications. We then discuss persistent challenges facing soft robotics, and suggest areas in which we see the greatest potential for societal impact. Conventionally, engineers have employed rigid materials to fabricate precise, predictable robotic systems, which are easily modelled as rigid members connected at discrete joints. Natural systems, however, often match or exceed the perfor- mance of robotic systems with deformable bodies. Cephalopods, for example, achieve amazing feats of manipulation and locomotion without a skeleton; even vertebrates such as humans achieve dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in their compliant bones and soft tissues. Inspired by nature, engineers have begun to explore the design and control of soft-bodied robots composed of compliant materials. This Review discusses recent developments in the emerging field of soft robotics. Design, fabrication and control of soft robots Daniela Rus 1 & Michael T.

All rights reserved Design and fabrication A robot is classified as hard or soft on the basis of the compliance of its underlying materials3. Soft robots are capable of continuum deformations, but not all continuum robots are soft. For example, the robotic elephant trunk manipulator17 is a discrete hyper-redundant continuum robot composed of rigid materials; the articulated cath- eter robot18 is an example of a hard continuum robot; OctArm19 (Fig. 3b) is an example of a semi-soft continuum robot; while the caterpillar robot20 (Fig. 1a) and the rolling belt robot21 are examples of soft continuum robots. These soft machines have modular bodies consisting of soft rubber segments, which can be composed seri- ally or in parallel to create complex morphologies. The body of a soft robot may consist of multiple materials with different stiffness properties11,22. A soft robot encases in a soft body all the subsystems of a conventional robot: an actuation system, a perception system, driving electronics and a computation system, with corresponding power sources. Technological advances in soft materials and subsys- tems compatible with the soft body enable the autonomous function of the soft robot. The rest of this section describes recent progress in developing subsystems for soft robots. With this range of compo- nents, design tools are used to create the topology of the robot body along with the placement of its functional components. Given the design road map, the robot is ready to be fabricated. Actuation The segments of a soft robot are usually actuated in one of two ways (Fig. 4): variable length tendons (in the form of tension cables23 or shape-memory alloy actuators24) may be embedded in soft segments, to achieve, for example, robotic octopus arms (Fig. 3f); or pneumatic actuation is used to inflate channels in a soft material and cause a desired deformation. Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs), also known as McKibben actuators, are examples of compliant linear soft actuators composed of elastomer tubes in fibre sleeves25,26. Fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) are a new type of highly extensible and adaptable, low-power soft actuator. FEAs comprise synthetic elas- tomer films operated by the expansion of embedded channels under pressure. Once pressurized, the actuator will keep its position with little or no additional energy consumption. FEAs can be operated pneumatically10,27–30 or hydraulically31,32. Given a small number of options for pressurized working fluid generation, and a significant difference between the time constants for the generators and actua- tors, pressure-regulating components such as regulators and valves are necessary. Regardless of the actuation method, soft actuators are frequently arranged in a biologically inspired agonist–antagonist arrangement (like muscles) to allow bidirectional actuation. Another benefit of this arrangement is that co-contraction of muscle pairs leads to adaptable compliance. The design and actuation of soft-robotic systems dates back to at least 1992, when a team demonstrated the impressive capabilities of soft, flexible microactuators27 (Fig. 3a). This work demonstrated the approach of pneumatic actuation of robotic elements composed of elastomer. In this approach, a fluid (usually air) is used to inflate channels in the elastomer, while some asymmetry in the design or constituent materials causes the component to actuate (move) in the desired way (Fig. 4). The resulting continuous, adaptive motions can seem surprisingly lifelike. Other groups29,33–35 (Fig. 2b, c) used soft lithography techniques adapted from microfluidics, as well as soft composite materials composed of various silicone polymers and elastomers at times embedded with paper or cloth, to design and fabricate pneumatically actuated soft systems. One challenge with these designs based on pneumatic networks (also referred to as pneu-nets) is that the high strains required for actuation can lead to slow actuation rates and rupture failures. A slightly more complex design for pneumatically actuated elastomeric soft robots reduced the material strain required for actuation36, and allowed the unteth- ered walking of a large, soft robot10. Soft-lithography fabrication approaches typically use a layer of stiffer rubber or elastomer, some- times with paper, fabric or a plastic film embedded, to achieve asym- metric strain for actuation. An alternative approach is to augment all elastomeric elements with flexible fibres, which limit the stress taken up by the elastomer during pneumatic actuation. The result is soft actuators with reduced extensibility and flexibility, but the ability to withstand higher actuation pressures, and hence apply larger forces.

All rights reserved it is possible to embed fibres directly into pneumatic elastomeric actuators to achieve agile motions based on bending13,27,37. Although most soft-robot prototypes have used pneumatic or hydraulic actuation, a great deal of research has focused on the development of electrically activated soft actuators composed of electroactive polymers (EAPs)38,39, which have also led to prototype systems22. Since energy is typically most readily stored in electrical form, and computation is usually done on electronic circuits, it may be more efficient to directly use electrical potential to actuate soft robots. Types of EAPs include dielectric EAPs, ferroelectric poly- mers, electrostrictive graft polymers, liquid crystal polymers, ionic EAPs, electrorheological fluids, ionic polymer–metal composites, and stimuli-responsive gels. Since a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this Review, we refer the reader to refs 38, 39 for details. In general, fabrication, performance, and long-term stability are active areas of research in EAPs. Instead of designing the stiffness of robotic systems by tuning their constituent materials, another line of soft-robotics research has sought to control material stiffness on the fly. One approach is to embed or encase soft materials with stiffer materials such as wax40 or metal41, which can be thermally softened. Embedded heaters can thus be used to adjust the structure’s effective stiffness and allow for compliant behaviour or actuated repositioning. Similarly, isothermal phase change caused by particle jamming has also been explored as a method of adjusting a soft robot’s rigidity for actuation42,43 (Fig. 2f), or even for grasping an impressive array of objects44 (Fig. 3c). Stretchable electronics So far, most integrated soft-robotic systems have relied on conven- tional, rigid electronics to store the control algorithms and connect to the systems’ actuators, sensors and power sources. However, there has recently been much research in the area of soft and stretchable electronics45–47. A full discussion of this area is beyond the scope of this Review, but, as this field of electronics matures, we expect greater integration with soft robots, resulting in completely soft prototypes. Sensing The compliance and morphology of soft robots precludes the use of many conventional sensors including encoders, metal or semi- conductor strain gauges, or inertial measurement units (IMUs). Although flexible-bending sensors based on piezoelectric polymers are available as commercial products, these may not be appropriate owing to the need for all elements of the system to be both bendable and stretchable. Soft, stretchable electronics may enable new sensing modalities48,49. The basis of proprioceptive sensors for a soft robot is usually either non-contact sensors or very low modulus elastomers combined with liquid-phase materials. Because soft robots are actu- ated by generating curvatures, proprioception relies on curvature sensors. The low modulus of proposed elastomer sensors (which have characteristic moduli in the range of 105–106 Pa) impart mini- mal change on the impedance of the underlying structures. These sensors generally have layered structures, in which multiple thin elastomer layers are patterned with microfluidic channels by soft lithography. The channels are subsequently filled with a liquid conductor (for example, gallium-containing alloys such as eutectic gallium–indium, or EGaIn). With layered channel geometries, it is possible to tailor sensors for measuring various strains including tensile, shear50 or curvature51. To address the fabrication challenges involved in injecting complex channel networks with liquid conduc- tor, recent work has investigated mask deposition of the conduc- tor52, or direct 3D printing of conductive material53. Alternatively, exteroceptive sensing may be used to measure the curvature of a soft robot’s body segments in real time30. To expand the applications of soft robotics, compatible chemical and biological sensors54 may be used to sense environmental signals. Such sensors may be more compatible with soft robots than the optical and audio recorders typically used in robotics. Power sources A big challenge for soft robots is stretchable, portable power sources for actuation. For pneumatic actuators, existing fluidic power sources are not soft and are usually big and bulky. Current off-the-shelf pressure sources are generally limited to compressors or pumps, and compressed air cylinders55. If we draw an analogy to electrical systems, compressors are similar to generators as they con- vert electrical energy into mechanical energy, and compressed gas cylinders are similar to capacitors as they store a pressurized fluid in a certain volume to be discharged when required. Miniature com- pressors use valuable electrical energy inefficiently, and cylinders of useful form factors do not offer longevity. What has been missing for fluidic systems is the equivalent of a battery, whereby a chemical reaction generates the necessary energy for actuation using a fuel. The chemically operated portable pressure source, or pneumatic battery28 (Fig. 2g), generates pressurized gas using a hydrogen per- oxide monopropellant56. Combustible fuels are another promising high-energy-density chemical fuel source57,58. Electrically powered actuators (as well as the electrical controllers for pneumatic systems) require soft, flexible, lightweight electrical power sources59. As with soft electronics, this is an active area of research. Recent promising developments include batteries based on graphene60, organic polymers61 and embedded conductive fabric62. Design Existing soft robotic systems have typically been designed with con- ventional 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software. However, cur- rent CAD software was not created with free-form 3D fabrication processes in mind, and does not easily accommodate the complex non-homogeneous 3D designs that may be desired for soft robot- ics. This has led researchers to either rely on relatively simple ‘2.5D’ Figure 2 | Approximate tensile modulus (Young’s modulus) of selected engineering and biological materials. Soft robots are composed primarily of materials with moduli comparable with those of soft biological materials (muscles, skin, cartilage, and so on), or of less than around 1 gigapascal. These materials exhibit considerable compliance under normal loading conditions. 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 8 10 9 10 10 10 11 10 12 Young’s modulus (Pa)RubberNylonFibreglassGlassSteelDiamondWoodAlginate hydrogelPolydimethylsiloxanePolyethylene (low density)Silicone elastomerBoneTooth enamelCartilageMuscleSkinTendonLiver tissueArteryFat 28 M A Y 2015 | V O L 521 | N A T U R E | 469 REVIEW INSIGHT © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved layered designs, or come up with customized approaches to the design and fabrication of each system, typically based on commer- cial 3D moulding techniques11,58. Following an alternative approach, researchers have used design automation algorithms inspired by evo- lution to design soft robots63. Soft-robot designs have been auto- matically generated using custom finite element analysis software (VoxCAD), which accommodates materials with a large range of moduli, coupled with design optimization using an evolutionary algorithm64. In addition, evolutionary algorithms have been used to automatically generate soft-robot designs65. Fabrication Recent progress in the field of soft robotics has been enabled by the development of rapid digital design and fabrication tools. Research- ers have manufactured complex soft-robotic systems by taking advantage of rapid and adaptable fabrication techniques66, includ- ing multimaterial 3D printing67, shape deposition manufacturing (SDM)68 and soft lithography69. These techniques can be combined to create composites with heterogenous materials (for example, rubber with different stiffness moduli), embedded electronics and internal channels for actuation31,70. Direct digital printing with soft materials may be another option for fabricating arbitrary soft struc- tures. A variety of robot bodies can be fabricated using these tech- niques. The next section discusses control systems supporting a wide range of soft-robot applications. Computation and control Unlike the control of rigid bodies, the movements of which can be described by six degrees of freedom (three rotations and three translations about the x, y and z axes), the movements of soft bodies cannot be confined to planar motions. Soft materials are elastic and can bend, twist, stretch, compress, buckle, wrinkle and so on. Such motion can be viewed as offering an infinite number of degrees of freedom, which makes the control of soft robots very challenging. Controlling soft robots requires new approaches to modelling, con- trol, dynamics, and high-level planning. The muscle analogy for soft actuators has driven a number of biologically inspired approaches to modelling and control for soft materials. The octopus arm is the prototypical example of a highly adaptive, soft actuator in nature that has been the source of inspira- tion for several biomimetic designs. Octopuses form pseudo-joints and use human-like strategies for precise point-to-point movements such as fetching71. An understanding of the working principles and control of soft organisms (such as the octopus) has led to a model for the control of soft robots72. Likewise, the caterpillar has provided an ideal model for mobile soft robots73. The study of these systems for the development and implementation of soft-robotic systems has, in turn, reflected back on our understanding of the mechanics and control of the associated natural systems74. Modelling and kinematics The kinematics and dynamics of soft-robotic systems are unlike those of conventional, rigid-bodied robots. When composed of a series of actuation elements, these robots approach a continuum behaviour. In theory, the final shape of the robot can be described by a continuous function, and modelling this behaviour requires continuous mathematics. Because soft robots are different from con- ventional rigid linkage-based systems, researchers have developed new static, dynamic and kinematic models that capture their ability to bend and flex75. Robots made entirely from soft elastomer and powered by fluids do not yet have well-understood models or planning and control algorithms, primarily because their intrinsic deformation is con- tinuous, complex and highly compliant. In addition, soft robots are often under-actuated; they can contain many passive degrees of freedom, and when driven with low-pressure fluids the available input fluid power is unable to compensate for gravitational loading. Designers often model the kinematics of soft robots using a sim- plifying assumption that leads to the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) model. The PCC model is equivalent to many other mod- elling approaches75. Building on the PCC model, researchers have developed methods to map the actuation space to the configuration Figure 3 | Grasping and manipulation, which are canonical challenges in robotics, can be greatly simplified with soft robotics.

All rights reserved space. These approaches are robot-specific in that they integrate the morphology of the robot and the characteristics of the actuation system. One approach uses Bernoulli–Euler beam mechanics to pre- dict deformation3,75,76; another develops a relationship between the joint variables and the curvature arc parameters77, and this applies to high and medium pressure robots; and a third presents models that describe the deformation of robots actuated with low pres- sures11,28,29. These models are the basis for the forward kinematics of their respective systems. However, the PCC model does not capture all aspects of soft robots and, in an effort to increase the envelope of the model, non-constant curvature models have been developed78. The inverse-kinematics problem, as posed in ref. 75 (computing the curvatures required to place a specified point on the robot body at a desired location), is more challenging. Existing literature has provided several approaches for semi-soft robots77,79. A limitation of existing approaches to solving the inverse-kinematics problem for linear soft bodies (for example, arms) is that currently neither the whole body, nor the pose of the end effector (which may be impor- tant for manipulation, sensing, and so on), are not considered in the solution. Autonomous obstacle avoidance and movement through a confined environment are difficult without a computational solution to the inverse-kinematics problem that is aware of the whole body of the robot in space. Real-time, closed-loop curvature controllers are required that drive the bending of the soft pneumatic body segments of the manipulator despite their high compliance and lack of kin- ematic constraints. One method for closed-loop curvature control of a soft-bodied planar manipulator30 uses the PCC assumption with a cascaded curvature controller. An alternative visual servo control approach for cable-driven soft-robotic manipulators has also been proposed80. The inverse-kinematics algorithm enables task–space planning algorithms to autonomously position their end effector (or some other part of their body) in free space; manoeuvre in confined envi- ronments; and grasp and place objects. These task–space algorithms require the planner to consider the entire robot body (the whole arm, for example, not just the end effector for manipulators). Exist- ing algorithms for whole-body control81 assume rigid body systems and have not been extended to soft-bodied robots. For whole-body control of soft robots, it is difficult to control the configuration of the whole soft body owing to compliance. One computational approach30 to whole-body planning for soft planar manipulators considers both the primary task of advancing the pose of the end effector of the soft robot, and the secondary task of positioning the changing envelope of the whole robot in relation to the environ- ment7,30. Control Researchers have used these models to develop new approaches to low-level control, inverse kinematics, dynamic operations and plan- ning for soft-robotic systems. An important aspect of these algo- rithms is the use of compliance when the robot interacts with its environment. Compliance allows the robot to adapt its shape and function to objects of unknown or uncertain geometry and is the basis for new control and planning algorithms for soft robots in the presence of uncertainly. For example, soft robots can execute pick and place operations without precise positioning or accurate geometric models of the object to be grasped44. Low-level control for soft robots is by pressure control using pres- sure transducers or volume control using strain sensors. Pressure control accommodates differences in actuator compliance. Volume control is an avenue to configuration control and supports set- ting a maximum safe displacement limit. Most fluid-powered soft robots use open-loop valve sequencing to control body-segment actuation. Valve sequencing means that a valve is turned on for some duration of time to pressurize the actuator and then turned off to either hold or deflate it. Many soft-robotic systems use this control approach10,21,28,29,34. Continuously adjustable, variable pressurization using a fluidic drive cylinder has been demonstrated30. Recent work has sought to develop control elements for pneumatic soft robots (for example, valves), which do not require electrical control signals. In this study, passive valves with memory allow the addressable con- trol of many soft-robotic actuators from a single controlled pressure source82. The dynamics of soft robots open the door for new robot capa- bilities. Much like a child on a swing set, repeatable positioning of a soft tentacle places it outside of its gravity compensation envelope, where the end effector could accomplish tasks. Physical phenomena common to soft robots — including actuation limits, the self-loading effects of gravity, and the high compliance of the manipulator — can be represented as constraints within a trajectory optimization algorithm that operates on a dynamic model of the soft robot7. One example dynamic manoeuvre enables soft robots to interact with humans by quickly grabbing objects directly from the hand of a human7. Dynamic control of soft robots can be achieved using a new dynamic model for a spatial soft fluidic elastomer manipula- tor, a method for identifying all unknown system parameters (the soft manipulator, fluidic actuators and continuous drive cylinders or valving), and a planning algorithm that computes locally opti- mal dynamic manoeuvres through iterative learning control. This approach represents actuation limits, the self-loading effects of gravity, and the high compliance of the manipulator, as constraints within the optimization. Dynamic models of hard and semi-soft continuum robots provide examples for a variety of control techniques for soft robots76,83,84.

Tatlicioglu et al.86 developed a dynamic model for, and provided simulations of, a planar extensible continuum manipulator using a Lagrangian approach. Luo et al.87 modelled the dynamics of a soft planar snake. Systems and applications In this section we review some of the systems that have been devel- oped so far to address a variety of potential applications to locomo- tion, manipulation and human–machine interaction. Locomotion Recent work has explored the modes of locomotion possible with (or enabled by) soft bodies (Fig. 1). Notably, studies of caterpillars have led to soft-robotic systems20,73, as well as to a further understanding of the control of motion in these animals74. An understanding of worm biomechanics also led to a bioinspired worm design com- posed of flexible materials and actuated by shape-memory actuators (SMAs)88, and an annelid-inspired robot actuated by dielectric elas- tomer22. A European initiative studied the biomechanics and con- trol of the octopus to produce a soft-robotic prototype9,24. Likewise, a self-contained, autonomous robotic fish actuated by soft fluidic actuators could swim forward, turn and adjust its depth11,31 (Fig. 5). This robot can execute a C-turn escape manoeuvre in 100 millisec- onds, which is on a par with its biological counterpart, enabling it to be used as an instrument (a physical model) for biological stud- ies. Soft-robotics projects have also explored quadrupedal locomo- tion10,29, rolling28 and snake-like undulation8. Jumping has also been achieved using internal combustion of hydrocarbon fuels to achieve rapid energy release57,58. Many of the exciting applications for soft robotics (such as search- and-rescue operations or environmental monitoring), require an autonomous, mobile system. However, most experimental soft robotic systems rely on power and/or control signals delivered through pneumatic and/or electrical tethers. Since typical actua- tion power sources (for example, air compressors or batteries) are relatively heavy (for example, 1.2 kg10), tethers greatly simplify sys- tem design by significantly reducing the required carrying capacity. One approach to achieving mobile systems is to tether a soft robot to a mobile rigid robot with a greater carrying capacity89. Untethered mobile systems have circumvented the challenge of carrying heavy power sources by operating underwater11,31 or rolling on a surface8,28 such that actuation system masses do not have to be lifted against gravity. Another approach has led to materials and designs tailored to operate at working pressures that are high enough to carry large payloads10. Manipulation Manipulation is one of the canonical challenges for robotics (Fig. 3). Soft systems have a natural advantage over rigid robots in grasping and manipulating unknown objects because the compliance of soft grippers allows them to adapt to a variety of objects with simple con- trol schemes. Grippers that employ isothermal phase change owing to granular jamming have taken advantage of this feature of soft sys- tems44,90. Under-actuated grippers composed of silicone elastomers with embedded pneumatic channels have also shown impressive adaptability13,33. Commercially developed systems have also demon- strated manipulation with lightweight grippers composed of inflated flexible (but not extensible) material91. As one of the more mature applications of soft-robotic technology, companies have begun to produce soft-robotic manipulators (for example, Pneubotics an Oth- erlab company, Empire Robotics and Soft Robotics). Medical and wearable applications One of the natural advantages of soft-robotic systems is the compat- ibility of their moduli with those of natural tissues for medical and wearable applications. Rigid medical devices or orthoses run the risk of causing damage or discomfort to human or animal tissue. In addi- tion, it can be difficult to perfectly replicate the motion of natural joints with rigid orthodics. One possibility is to integrate a degree of compliance into wearable devices, for example for orthopaedic rehabilitation. Recently, researchers have begun to look at medi- cal, wearable applications for soft robotics, including soft wearable Figure 5 | A soft robotic fish.

Soft cyborgs Recent work has begun to investigate robotic systems that directly integrate biological (as opposed to artificial, biologically compatible) materials. Because biological materials are often very soft, the result- ing systems are soft-robotic systems (or perhaps they would be more aptly named soft cyborgs). For example, microbes that digest organic material and produce electricity have powered artificial muscles for autonomous robots96, and cardiomyocytes have been used to power a jellyfish-inspired swimming cyborg97. One challenge with using swarms of inexpensive soft robots for exploration is retrieving the robots once the task is completed. One way to avoid this problem is to develop biodegradable and soft robots powered by gelatin actua- tors98. Since gelatin is edible, there may also be medical applications for this technology. Future directions The field of soft robotics aims to create the science and applications of soft autonomy by asking the questions: how do we design and control soft machines, and how do we use these new machines? Current research on the algorithmic and device-level aspects of soft robots has demonstrated soft devices that can locomote, manipulate, and interact with people and their environment in unique ways. Soft mobile robots capable of locomotion on unknown terrain and soft-robot manipulators capable of pose-invariant and shape-invariant grasping rely on compliance to mitigate uncertainty and adapt to their environment and task. These basic behaviours open the door to applications in which robots work closely with humans. For example, a soft-robot manipulator could han- dle and prepare a wide variety of food items in the kitchen while a soft mobile robot could use contact to guide patients during physiotherapy exercises. The soft home robot could assist the elderly with monitoring their medicine regimens, whereas a soft factory robot could support humans in delicate assembly tasks. But how do we get to the point where soft robots deliver on their full potential? We need rapid design tools and fabrication recipes for low-cost soft robots, novel algorithmic approaches to the control of soft robots that account for their material properties, tools for developing device-specific programming environments that allow non-experts to use the soft machines, creative individuals to design new solutions and early adopters of the technology. The soft-robotics community is creating materials that have the ability to compute, sense and move, leading to a convergence between materials and machines. The materials are becoming more like computers owing to embedded electro-mechanical components, and machines are get- ting softer owing to the alternative materials used to create them. This convergence requires tools for functional specification and automated co-design of the soft body (including all the components necessary for actuation, sensing and computation) and the soft brain (including all software aspects of controlling the device and reasoning about the world and the goal task). Progress in new materials with programmable stiff- ness properties, proprioceptive sensing, contact modelling, and recipes for rapid fabrication will enable the creation of increasingly more capable soft machines. But how soft should a soft robot be in order to meet its true potential? As with many aspects of robotics, this depends on the task and environ- ment. For domains that require extreme body compliance (for example, inspecting a pipe with complex geometry or laproscopic surgery) or dealing with a great amount of uncertainty (for example, locomotion on rocky uneven terrain or grasping unknown objects), soft machines can bring the capabilities of robots to new levels. However, soft robots are difficult to model and control, especially when they need to retain a desired body configuration without external support (for example, an elephant trunk holding an object at a desired height in the presence of gravity). Augmenting soft machines with skeletons, much like verte- brates, could simplify such tasks. An important consideration for the future of soft machines is how to match the softness of the body to the range of capabilities expected from the machine in a way that most effec- tively leverages the body. Rapid fabrication recipes and tools for soft robots with embedded electronics are needed to expand the user base beyond experts. In addi- tion, more advances are needed to expand the computation and control capabilities of existing systems. The current approaches to robot control rely on external localization. But soft robots that operate autonomously need the ability to localize proprioceptively. Current models for soft robots do not capture their dynamics. Improved dynamics models will lead to more capable controllers. Although the current planners for soft robots allow the systems to collide harmlessly with their environments, the collisions are not detected. Contact with the environment, however, can be a useful aspect of task-level planning. Soft robots have the potential to provide a link between living systems and artificial systems at multiple levels: high-level tasks, in interactions between humans and robots, and in cognition. Pfeifer and Bongard 99 have argued that bodies are central to the way that we think. This view — embodied artificial intelligence — holds that robotic bodies and brains must be considered and developed in concert, much as the bodies and brains of their biological counterparts co-evolved. Soft-robotic systems have the potential to exploit morphological computation to adapt to, and interact with, the world in a way that is difficult or impossible with rigid systems. Following the principles of embodied artificial intelligence, soft robots may allow us to develop biologically inspired artificial intelligence in ways that are not possible with rigid-bodied robots. ■ Received 27 November 2014, accepted 1 May 2015. 1.
