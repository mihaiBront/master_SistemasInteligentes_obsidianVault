Partition clustering Use the C-means algorithm and Euclidean distance to cluster the following 8 examples into 3 clusters: A1 = (2,10), A2 = (2,5), A3 = (8,4), A4 = (5,8), A5 = (7,5), A6 = (6,4), A7 = (1,2), A8 = (4,9). The distance matrix based on the Euclidean distance is given below: Suppose that the initial seeds (centres of each cluster) are A1, A4 and A7. Run the C-means algorithm for 1 epoch only. At the end of this epoch show: a) The new clusters (i.e. the examples belonging to each cluster) b) The centres of the new clusters c) Draw a 10 by 10 space with all the 8 points and show the clusters after the first epoch and the new centroids. d) How many more iterations are needed to converge? Draw the result for each epoch. Exercise 2. Hierarchical clustering (I) Use single-linkage and complete-linkage agglomerative clustering using the Euclidean distance to group the data described by the following distance matrix. Show the distance matrices and dendrograms. Exercise 3. Hierarchical clustering (II) Use complete-linkage agglomerative clustering using the Euclidean distance to group the data described by the following distance matrix. Show the distance matrices.
