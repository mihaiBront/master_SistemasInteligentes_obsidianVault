Overview (YouTube) 3 Motion field Motion field vs optic flow (YouTube) Motion field vs Optic flowApplication: Optical mouse https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mouse 18 x 18 ~ 1k frames/s Application: Autonomous driving Optical Flow for Autonomous Driving: Applications, Challenges and Improvements (arXiv 2023) object tracking visual odometry semantic segmentation motion segmentation SLAM Application: Action recognition • Optical flow is useful because it is invariant to appearance, even when the flow vectors are inaccurate • EPE of current methods is not well correlated with action recognition performance • Training optical flow to minimize classification error instead of minimizing EPE improves recognition performance On the Integration of Optical Flow and Action Recognition (GCPR 2018) Application: video stabilisation SteadyFlow: Spatially Smooth Optical Flow for Video Stabilization (CVPR 2014) More videos at project page input output Application: Your turn www.socrative.com Room 219986 Think of an (interesting) application of optical flow estimation Theoretical assumptions Assumption 1: Brightness remains constant over time Assumption 2: Displacement and time step are small can be linearly approximated Optical flow constrained equation (YouTube) Taylor series expansion Linear approximation by ignoring H.O.T. In our case, we have three variables (x, y, t) Optical flow constraint equation 13 Computing partial derivativesGeometric interpretation of OF equation underconstrained Aperture problem Locally, only the normal flow can be determined To fully solve the OF equation, we need additional constraints www.socrative.com Room 219986 True or false? The aperture problem does not depend on the image contents; it is an intrinsic limitation of the optical flow constraint equation 17 Lucas-Kanade method Assumption: flow is the same in a small neighbourhood W n equations, 2 unknowns Linearly independent? Lucas-Kanade (YouTube) 18 Least Squares 19 Must be invertible Must be well-conditioned 20 textureless edge textured 21 textureless edge textured www.socrative.com Room 219986 Where can OF estimates be more reliable? A B C BA C 23 What about large motions? Linear approximation no longer valid Optic flow equation not valid Coarse-to-fine approach (YouTube) Coarse-to-fine strategy Repeat OF and warp (accumulating flows!) 26 Alternative approach: template matching Slow (for large search windows) Mismatches are possible 27 Horn-Schunk method Smoothness term Would we minimise or maximise E? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn-Schunck_method Dense or sparse method?
