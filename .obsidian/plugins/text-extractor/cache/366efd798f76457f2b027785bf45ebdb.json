The most basic measures are accuracy and classification error: 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 = 𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 = 𝐹𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 = 1 − 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 Confusion matrix (iv) Accuracy and classification error can be very misleading For instance, suppose a data set with 100 instances where 99 belong to class ‘A’ and only 1 belongs to class ‘B’. A model that predicts all instances to class ‘A’ will have an accuracy of 99%, but the accuracy here provides us with little information on how actually the model is performing We need other more elaborated measures to evaluate the models in some problems, and more specifically in class imbalanced problems Other evaluation measures • False positive rate (false alarm): the proportion of negative observations that were wrongly (as positive) predicted by the model 𝐹𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝐹𝑃 𝐹𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 • False negative rate (miss rate): the proportion of the positives that were classified as negative by the model 𝐹𝑁𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝐹𝑁 𝐹𝑁 + 𝑇𝑃 Other evaluation measures (ii) • True positive rate (recall, sensitivity): the proportion of positives that were classified correctly by the model. It is the opposite of FNrate 𝑇𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 = 1 − 𝐹𝑁𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 • True negative rate (specificity): the proportion of negatives that were classified correctly by the model. It indicates how good the model is at avoiding the misclassification of the negatives 𝑇𝑁𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝑇𝑁 𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑃 = 1 − 𝐹𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 Other evaluation measures (iii) • Precision (positive predicted value): the proportion of the positives compared to what the model predicted as positive. Unlike TPrate, Precision provides the percentage of TP over all instances predicted as positive 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃 • Negative predicted value: the proportion of the negative compared to what the model predicted as negative 𝑁𝑃𝑉 = 𝑇𝑁 𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑁 Other evaluation measures (iv) All these metrics are useful, but they are often used in pairs, such as Recall-Precision, FPrate-FNrate, TPrate-TNrate, etc. Other evaluation measures (v) • Geometric mean of accuracies: it achieves the maximum value when the accuracy on each of the classes is maximum while keeping these accuracies balanced 𝐺𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 = 𝑇𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ∙ 𝑇𝑁𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 • Mean class weighted accuracy: 𝐶𝑊𝐴 = 𝑤 × 𝑇𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 + (1 − 𝑤) × 𝑇𝑁𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 where 𝑤 ∈ [0,1] Other evaluation measures (vi) • F-measure: 𝐹 − 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 = (1 + 𝛽2) ∙ 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 ∙ 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝛽2 ∙ 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 + 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 where 𝛽 ∈ [0,1]. If precision and recall are equally important, then  is set to 1, and F-measure is known as the F1-measure • Area under the ROC curve: 𝐴𝑈𝐶 = 𝑇𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 + 𝑇𝑁𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 2 Other evaluation measures (vi) • Matthews correlation coefficient: 𝑀𝐶𝐶 = 𝑇𝑃 ∙ 𝑇𝑁 − 𝐹𝑃 ∙ 𝐹𝑁 (𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃) ∙ (𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁) ∙ (𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑃) ∙ (𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑁) MCC ranges between -1 and 1 (the best agreement between true values and predictions). MCC = 0 means that the prediction is random with the true values. • Gini coefficient: 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖 = 2 × 𝐴𝑈𝐶 − 1 Regression models • In regression, evaluation methods depend on the ways of calculating the residual (difference between the actual and predicted values): – some methods (e.g., sum squared error, mean squared error and root mean squared error) just calculate this difference – others (e.g., adjusted coefficient of determination) also take into account the problem of overfitting Regression models (ii) • In regression, unlike classification (where we can count the number of observations correctly classified), our predictions are either bigger or smaller than the actual value (rarely it is same as the actual value) • Thus, we are not concerned with how many times we were wrong but rather what matters is the size of residuals • To validate a regression model, you must use residual plots to visually confirm the validity of the model Regression models (iii) Residual plots: the residual values on the y-axis and the predicted values on the x-axis • if it has a high density of points close to the origin and a low density of points far from the origin and they are distributed symmetrically around the horizontal axis, the regression model is appropriate Regression models (iv) How to know whether a residual plot is good based on the characteristics just presented? If we project all the residuals onto the y-axis, we get a normally distributed curve. This satisfies the assumption that residuals are independent and normally distributed Measures to compare multiple data sets • Mean/median of prediction: we can understand the bias in prediction between two models using the arithmetic mean of the predicted values. If there are outliers, it is better to use the median • Standard deviation of prediction: it is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values 𝑆𝐷 = σ𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝑦𝑖 − ത𝑦)2 𝑛 − 1 A low SD indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set. In contrast, a high SD indicates that the values are distributed over a wider range Measures to compare multiple data sets (ii) • Range of prediction: it is the maximum and minimum values in a data set, helping to understand its dispersion • Coefficient of variation (relative standard deviation): it simply represents the variance standardized by its mean 𝐶𝑉(%) = 𝑆𝐷 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 × 100 SD is the most common measure of variability/dispersion for a single data set, but it is not useful when comparing two different data sets. In such cases, CV is the method of choice Measures to compare multiple data sets (iii) For instance, consider two different data sets: • Data 1: Mean1 = 120000; SD1 = 2000 • Data 2: Mean2 = 900000; SD2 = 10000 It seems that Data 2 is more spread out than Data 1 However, let us now calculate CV for both data sets: • CV1 = SD1/Mean1x100 = 1.6% • CV2 = SD2/Mean2x100 = 1.1% We can conclude Data 1 is more spread out than Data 2 Common evaluation measures • Sum squared error: it calculates the difference between the true (𝑦𝑖) and predicted ( ො𝑦𝑖) values across the n test observations 𝑆𝑆𝐸 = ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖)2 • Mean squared error: it is the SSE divided by the number of test observations. This is the most common metric for regression 𝑀𝑆𝐸 = 1 𝑛 ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖)2 • Root mean squared error: it is the square root of MSE 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 = 𝑀𝑆𝐸 Common evaluation measures (ii) • The lower the MSE/RMSE value, the better the model is with predictions • A high MSE/RMSE indicates that there are large deviations between the predicted and actual values • Drawbacks of MSE/RMSE: – sensitive to outliers – a single big error will have the same effect as many small errors Common evaluation measures (iii) The predictions of Model-One had an error of 1 for all 10 samples; for Model-Two, 9 samples were predicted correctly, but one prediction had an error of 4.16 → the single big error made by Model-Two has the same impact as the 10 small errors made by Model-One Other evaluation measures • Relative squared error: it takes the total squared error of our model and normalizes by the total squared error of a model that uses the mean as the predictor 𝑅𝑆𝐸 = σ𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖) 2 σ𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝑦𝑖 − ത𝑦)2 where ത𝑦 = 1 𝑛 σ𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑦𝑖 RSE > 1 indicates that our model is even worse than a model that simply predicts the mean as a prediction for each sample RSE = 0 corresponds to the ideal case Other evaluation measures (ii) • Mean absolute error: it is similar to MSE, but instead of squaring the difference between the actual and predicted values, this takes an absolute value of it 𝑀𝐴𝐸 = 1 𝑛 ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖 Unlike MSE/RMSE, here a big error does not overpower a lot of small errors → the output provides us with a relatively unbiased understanding of how the model is performing Other evaluation measures (iii) • Median absolute error: it is the median of all absolute differences between the actual and predicted values 𝑀𝑒𝑑𝐴𝐸 = 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖 ) • Mean absolute percentage error: it is calculated as the absolute difference between the actual and predicted values divided over every observation 𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸 = 1 𝑛 ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖 𝑦𝑖 × 100 Other evaluation measures (iv) • Relative absolute error: like RSE, it is also used to compare between models whose errors are measured in different units 𝑅𝐴𝐸 = σ𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖 σ𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑦𝑖 − ത𝑦 where ത𝑦 = 1 𝑛 σ𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑦𝑖 RAE ranges from 0 to infinity, with 0 corresponding to the ideal case Other evaluation measures (v) • Coefficient of determination (R2): this is a statistical measure that determines how well a regression model predicts an outcome. This means how good is a model for a data set 𝑅2 = 1 − σ𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖) 2 σ𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝑦𝑖 − ത𝑦)2 R2 lies between 0 and 1 R2 = 0 indicates that the model fails to accurately model the data at all The closer its value to 1, the better a model is Other evaluation measures (vi) • Adjusted coefficient of determination: it penalizes adding more independent variables which do not increase the explanatory power of the regression model. It is always less than or equal to the value of R2 𝑎𝑑𝑗_𝑅2 = 1 − (1 − 𝑅2) 𝑛 − 1 𝑛 − 𝑝 − 1 where p is the number of independent variables and n the sample size","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
