The instances belong to two classes: class ‘0’ (Non- Defaulters) and class ‘1’ (Defaulters). We fit a classifier on this data set and obtain the following confusion matrix. Calculate the following metrics: accuracy, error rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predicted value, negative predicted value, geometric mean of accuracies, mean class weighted accuracy (with w=0 and w=1), F-measure (with =0 and =1), AUC, and Gini coefficient.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
