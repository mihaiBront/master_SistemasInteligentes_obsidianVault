From the motivation behind collaborative robots to the need for predictive control 7 1.2. From the motivation behind collaborative robots to the need for predictive control Behind humanoid robotics lies a vast range of ﬁelds and applications with di\u0000use, and almost inexistent frontiers: the coalescence of knowledge issued from cogni- tive, biomechanical, electronic, computer, automation and mechanical sciences is employed in addressing factual and anticipated challenges, centered around the objective of assisting the human. While electronic, computer, automation and mechanical developments contribute to the set of tools we possess to craft robotic solutions, cognitive and biomechan- ical sciences provide means to not only understand human activity but also iden- tify mechanisms which can inspire the robotic approaches, and lead to e\u0000cient robot design and control. The assistive function of robots nowadays spans a wide range of nature. Al- though developments of applications where robots replace the humans in harmful environments or tasks are still spreading, recent advances in robotics along with current societal and economic issues drew the emergence of a collaborative robotic assistance. As illustrated in ﬁgure 1.3, the growing interest and fast development of collaborative robotics already allow the introduction of industrial-grade solu- tions on production processes. Figure 1.3.: Industrial-grade collaborative robots. From left to right — KUKA IIWA, Universal Robots UR5, ABB YuMi, Audi PART4you. The developments in haptic technologies and soft robotics, along with the minia- turization and growing e\u0000ciency of actuators and power sources provided tools supporting the progress of two robotics forks: collaborative robotics and assis- tive robotics to address unemployment, competitiveness and population aging challenges. Collaborative robotics focus on the integration of safe robots able to cooperate and interact with human partners while assistive robotics mainly comprise wearable rehabilitation devices such as orthoses and exoskeletons. Both applications inevitably imply the necessity of a durable, ﬂexible and pre- dominantly safe physical interaction between the robot and its human partner; this statement is afortiori legitimate for humanoid robotics and its applications, being explicitly designed to interact with human environments. Achieving safe interaction between human and robots is mainly twofold: both mechanical design and control have a strong inﬂuence on the degree of harm a robot can cause. Indeed, as further discussed in [DeSantis2008], minimizing injury risk may not only come from increasingly lightweight and compliant mech- anisms but also from consistent, adaptive and anticipative control.

With an object-detecting Kinect camera for a head, HERB relies on image-analysis software to ﬁnd things, such as a piece of fruit or a microwave- able meal. It then grasps the object (each of its hands has three multi- jointed ﬁngers). RGBD sensors process red, green, and blue color information as well as depth—so HERB can ﬁgure out the distance to an object. In the process, the robot can determine the optimal way to move its limbs without accidentally bump- ing into something. For now, HERB is used only for research; it won’t be in homes anytime soon. Another of Srinivasa’s projects is the Assistive Dexterous Arm (ADA—an acronym chosen to honor computing pioneer Ada Lovelace). The portable, flexible arm, with two mechanical fingers, weighs less than 10\"kilograms [photo, opposite page]. Clipped to a wheelchair or table, it can help feed people unable to grasp utensils on their own. Srinivasa says the ADA is learn- ing several more things: how to ladle hot soup, for example, twirl spaghetti on a fork, and cut meat. And timing is important, he notes: The ADA needs to read social cues to determine when to dole out the next bite of food. A person eating with a friend doesn’t necessarily take a bite right after swallowing the last one. The next bite might come only after she has stopped speaking, or when her companion briefly looks away. The team is still working on algorithms to deter- mine the right time to serve up the next spoonful or forkful of food.

IEEE Fellow Rory Cooper [above, left] has been working for decades on designing autonomous wheelchairs and attachments to help people explore the world in ways previously thought impossible. Cooper is director of the Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL), a joint eﬀort of the University of Pittsburgh and the U.S.\"Department of Veterans Aﬀairs. $irty percent of the faculty and student researchers at HERL have a disability. In 1980 while serving as a U.S.\"Army sergeant in Worms, Germany, he sustained a spinal-cord injury in a bicycle acci- dent that left him partially paralyzed. He and other HERL researchers recently developed the Mobility Enhancement Robotic Wheelchair (MEBot), which can handle rugged terrain yet is narrow enough to cruise through doorways and down hallways. $e researchers were challenged to build the chair by the U.S.\"Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Regiment. $e MEBot has six wheels—two large drive wheels (about 35\"centi- meters in diameter) in the middle and four caster wheels: two in front and two in back. When the wheelchair senses a curb, the front casters lift onto it, fol- lowed by the drive wheels. It’s a smooth climb that doesn’t jostle the passenger. When the wheelchair goes up a ramp, sensors detect the incline and adjust the seat to keep it level. $e chair can navigate slippery surfaces, where traditional power wheelchairs some- times get stuck or spin their wheels. $e ultimate goal is for the MEBot to climb a ﬂight of stairs, Cooper says. Cooper also invented the PARA (patient assist robotic arm), and he is working with RE2 Robotics, a Pittsburgh startup, to bring it to market. $e PARA attaches to the edge of a standard power wheelchair’s seat and can help people transfer from the chair to a car, toilet, or couch. People who use wheelchairs can have trouble transferring out of them unless the destination is near the same height and only a few centimeters away. $e PARA can lift a person who weighs up to 113\"kilograms and handle the transfer over greater distances. Hooks on the arm attach to a sling, which supports the person being lifted. $e team recently was awarded a US\"$75,000 grant from the U.S.\"National Institutes of Health to develop a com- mercial prototype, which is still a few years away from completion. “We are working to give people with severe disabilities from spinal cord injuries or ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis] a level of mobility that is simply unprecedented,” Cooper says. !
