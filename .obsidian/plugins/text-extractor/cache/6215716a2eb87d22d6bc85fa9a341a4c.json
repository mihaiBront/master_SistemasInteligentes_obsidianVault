(§3) = 4 (dimensionality of the feature space) c = 3 (number of classes) N = 10 (number of objects in Z) b) Consider a classifier D, which consists of the following set of discriminant functions g 1(x) = x1 + x2 g2(x) = x2 + 2x3 g3(x) = 3x4 – x3 Run D on Z and give the (guessed) labels of all the objects.

(§1) P(class 1) = 2/10 = 0.2 P(class 2) = 5/10 = 0.5 P(class 3) = 3/10 = 0.3 . Consider the classification problem shown in the figure below. The data is depicted as points and the (true) class labels are shown by different markers: class 1 with dots and class 2 with crosses. The object numbers are given next to the markers. Your classifier, D, operates in the following way: for a point x that you want to classify, find the nearest point in Z. Assign x to the class of its nearest neighbour (this is called the nearest neighbour classifier, more on it – later on the modules). In the case of a tie, resolve in favour of the class with the lower number (class 1 here). 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (a) Find the leave-one-out error of D.

Stage1: Objects 1,2,3 and 4 are used for “training” (they form the data set from which we select the nearest neighbour) and objects 5,6 and 7 are used for testing. Stage 2: Objects 1,3,5,7 are used for training and objects 2,4,6 are used for testing. Stage 3: objects 3,4,5 and 6 are used for training and objects 1,2, and 7 are used for testing. The errors on the three testing sets are averaged to obtain an estimate of the error of D. Find this estimate. (§4) tage 1 Object 5 6 7 Nearest neighbour 4 4 4 Error?
