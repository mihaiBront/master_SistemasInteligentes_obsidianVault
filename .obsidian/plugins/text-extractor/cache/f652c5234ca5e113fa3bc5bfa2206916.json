The idea of SSL is that if the model can solve a complicated task that requires high-level understanding of the input, then it will learn more generalisable features 1213141516 Do different pretext tasks make any difference? Are time-related pretext tasks more helpful? 17 Generative approaches GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) 18 Predicting next frame 19 Masked modelling 20Masked Motion Encoding for Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning (CVPR 2023) 21Masked Motion Encoding for Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning (CVPR 2023) 22 Contrastive learning View augmentation Temporal augmentation Spatio-temporal augmentation Multi-modal alignment Clustering* anchor positive negative (*) Not seen here 23 Contrastive loss Triplet loss https://www.baeldung.com/cs/contrastive-learning Y=0 if xi and xj have the same labels (and 1 otherwise) Noise Contrastive Estimation Loss (NCE) Uses a pair of positive and a set of negative examples Do the contrastive loss and the triplet loss require the same data at the same time?
