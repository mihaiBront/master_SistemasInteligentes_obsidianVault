Speech acts ■ The main inspiration for the treatment of multiagent communication is based on the speech act theory ■ Speech act theories are pragmatic theories, that is, theories of language usage: they try to determine how people use language to achieve their intentions and goals. ■ The origin of speech record theories can be traced back to Austin's 1962 book How to Do Things with Words. Speech acts ■ JL Austin (1911-1960) noted that some pronunciations were like \"physical actions\" in that they seemed to imply a change in the state of the world. ■ Paradigmatic examples could be: ❑ Declare war ❑ Christianity ❑ I pronounce you husband and wife’ :-) ■ But generally, everything we utter is done with the intention of satisfying some goal or intention. ■ Speech act theory is a theory of how utterances are used to achieve intentions. Fundamental aspects of the Speech Act Theory ■ Act of locution: physical sounds of the speaker. ■ Act of illocution: meaning of the sound for the speaker. ■ Act of perlocution: the intended action as a consequence of the locution. Speech Acts Searle (1969) identified several different types of speech acts: ■ representative : such as reporting, for example, 'it is raining' ■ directives: attempts to get the listener to do something, e.g., 'heat my milk' ■ commissive: that commit the speaker to do something, e.g., 'I promise you that... ' ■ expressive: by which the speaker expresses a state of mind, e.g., 'thank you! ' ■ declarative: such as declaring a war or Christianity Speech acts ■ It is not clear whether reaching this level of detail in speech act theory is useful or simply convenient. ■ However, in general, a speech act can be seen as consisting of two components: ❑ a performative verb: (e.g., ask, inform, promise, …) ❑ propositional content: (e.g., “the door is closed”) For example, ■ performative = request ■ content = \"the door is closed\" ■ speech act = “please close the door” ■ performative = informative ■ content = \"the door is closed\" ■ speech act = “the door is closed!” ■ performative = question ■ content = \"the door is closed\" ■ speech act = “is the door closed?” Based plans semantics ■ How to define the semantics of speech acts? How can a receiver distinguish between a request and information? ■ The sender cannot (generally) force the receiver to accept some desired state of mind. ■ In other words, there is a separation between the acts of illocution and perlocution. ■ Here is the semantics for request: request(s, h, φ) pre: s believes h can do φ (don't ask anyone to do a task you think they can't do) s believes h believes h can do φ (don't ask anyone to do a task if you think they don't think they can do it) s believes s wants φ (you don't ask anyone for something you don't want) ■ post: h believe s believe s want φ (the effect is to make the listener “aware” of your desire) KQML and KIF ■ Consider agent communication languages (ACLs) — standard message exchange formats ■ The best known ACL is KQML, developed at the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Initiative (KSE) ■ KQML is made up of two parts: ❑ The Knowledge Manipulation and Query Language (KQML) ❑ The Knowledge Exchange Format (KIF) ■ KQML is the 'output' language, the one that defines the various \"verbs of communication\" or performatives ■ Example performatives: ❑ ask-if ('is it true that... ') ❑ perform ('please perform the following action. . . ') ❑ tell (‘it is true that...’) ❑ reply (‘the answer is . . . ’) ■ KIF is the language to express the content of the message KQML communication optionsMensajes KQML (ask-one :content (price(ibm, Model, Cost)) :receiver store :language Prolog :ontology InfSupplies ) Answer 1 info (ask-all :content (price(ibm, Model, Cost)) :receiver store :language Prolog :ontology InfSupplies ) Answer all infos (stream-all :content (price(ibm, Model, Cost)) :receiver store :language Prolog :ontology InfSupplies ) Answer 1 by 1 sinc.

All the others are defined based on these. They are the primitives. ■ The meaning of inform and request is defined in two parts: ❑ pre-condition which must be true for the speech act to work ❑ \"rational effect\" what the sender of the message expects to be done ■ For the informative performative… ■ The content is a sentence. ■ The Pre-condition is that the sender: ❑ Keep the content true ❑ Try to have the receiver create the content ❑ Do not believe that the receiver has a formed idea about whether or not the content is true “Inform” and “Request” ■ For the performative request... Content is an action. The Pre-condition is that the sender: ■ Try to get the action done ■ Believe that the receiver is capable of performing this action ■ Don't think the receiver was already going to execute it anyway","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
