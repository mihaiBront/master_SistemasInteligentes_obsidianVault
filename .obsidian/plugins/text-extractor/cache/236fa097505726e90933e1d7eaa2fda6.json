Vision-based planar grasp synthesisThe Reactive Paradigm • Biologically based: – Reflex Behaviors (independent processes), released by perceptual or internal events (state) – No world models or long term memory – Short connections between sensors and actuators: fast response to changes in world SENSE ACT A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 (Simple version) A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 The Stretch Reflex It reveals some “elementary” processing in the spinal cord A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 The vestibulo-ocular reflex From Zigmond et al. Fundamental Neuroscience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_R0LcPnZ_w A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 We are not so different… Damage to higher control (upper brainstem) -> •They become autonomous and overactive •Continued activity of neural centers below the level of the lesion From Zigmond et al. Fundamental Neuroscience Organization of the Reflective Paradigm Sensing is Behavior-Specific or Local Behaviors can “share” perception without knowing it A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Arkin’s Schema Theory Reactive Robots A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Dependability! How to solve the problem of the “Dumb Japanese Robot” Reactive Robots A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Solution 1: “Acceleration reflex” SENSE ACT • Sense: Detect acceleration with the torque/force sensor (blue disk) • Act: Increase force at fingers Reactive Robots A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Solution 1: “Acceleration reflex” Without reflex With reflex Reactive Robots A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Solution 1: “Acceleration reflex” In some cases it will need precise calibration Reactive Robots A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Solution 2: “Void reflex” • Sense: Detects when void is lost • Act: Try again A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Pick Task at the 2017 Amazon Robotics Challenge in Nagoya Baxter has to find some items in 3 orders and put them in 3 boxes (watch from min 3:00) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tg94YRx87s Reactive Robots Solution 2: “Void reflex” Reactive Robots A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 What if the gripper has no sensors? • Solution 3a: Add sensors! • Solution 3b: use vision Pincher gripper with infrared sensor mounted on finger How to visually detect if an object is grasped?

A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Traditional Model “The traditional model where cognition mediates between perceptions and plans of actions” A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 New Model “The new model where the perceptual and action subsystems are all there really is. Cognition is only in the eye of an observer” A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Intelligence without Models Rodney Brooks says: • “The World is its Best Own Model” => Use sensors to perceive the world • Internal world models are impossible to obtain • Internal world models are not necessary for action • If you are doing simulations in robotics you are wasting your time …and your sponsor's money Bottom-up Approach to AI What if instead of decomposing “human level intelligence” into parts and interfaces… we start with simpler complete systems? • Follow the evolutionary path: from simple to complex organisms • Most of intelligence \"is routine activity in a dynamic world” • Thought and consciousness don’t need to be programmed in: They will emerge 35 The Complete-Agent Principle The complete agent principle states that when designing agents we must think about the complete agent behaving in the real world. A.P. del Pobil - SIU015 Behavior-Based Systems • Building blocks = low-level reactive behaviors • behaviors + complex environment = complex behavior • inspired by animal behavior Rooted in behaviors vs. symbolic AI Cog, MIT AI Lab.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
