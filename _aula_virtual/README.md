# 1. Initial Idea and motivation

## 1.1 Motivation

For a diabetic, it is sometimes difficult predicting how much insulin should he administrate when eating a certain meal.

The main sources of glucose in a meal are either:
- **Sugars**: Short chains, or straight up molecules, of glucose that are directly absorbed by the organism, and have a strong yet short-lasting impact on the blood-glucose. On a graph, it translates in a short high peak in measurements
- **Carbohydrates**: Longer glucid chains that take longer to break before being absorbed, and have a lower intensity, longer acting impact on the blood-glucose graph, translating in a longer, lower curve.

It is not always obvious how to estimate how a meal will affect the patient; there can be some ingredients that are not intuitively related to a high carbohydrates' concentration.

This is why we think creating an application that could help to predict how a patient's glucose will behave after consuming a known meal would be a great idea!

## 1.2 Concept

The proposed application is based on searching by ingredient (the ones the user has in its fridge) and generating recipes based on said ingredients.

Then, by accessing his sensor's API, the last 24h of readings can be accessed, and from those and the nutritional values of the selected recipe, a forecast of his glucose can be predicted.

# 2. The project and its structure

This solution can be deployed as a single container, which will launch the solution in this repository.

Diagram of the solution:

![Solution diagram](.readme/structureDiagram.png)

The main app (*`SERVER`*) runs when the container is started.

The server is in charge of:
 - Serving a website on `localhost:5000` (`WEB CLIENT` part of the diagram above) and handling the user's interactions.
 - Making requests to external APIs (*Spoonacular* for recipes and nutritional information, and *LibreView* for the user's glucose readings)
 - Taking the glucose data, the user's input for intended insulin administration, and the carbohydrates in the selected recipe, and estimating the next hour's glucose.

Below is a summary of the solution's directory structure and an explanation of each one of the modules in that solution.

## 2.2 Image generation and development preparation

This section of the project contains scripts and utils for helping running the project

### 2.2.1 `./.scripts`

Scripts in charge of preparing the system for running the code, aimed to Linux:

- `env-setup.bash` Is a script in charge of:
  - Installing the needed Linux `apt` packages, such as python, python-venv and python-is-python3
  - Creating a virtual environment in `{root}/.venv`
  - Installing all the `pip` dependencies found in `requirements.txt`
  - Downloading the model for glucose prediction to `{root}/reggressionGlucoseSimple.joblib`, which is too big to be uploaded to GitHub
- `env-setup_deploy.bash` does the same as `env-setup.bash` but with minor tweaks for running inside the container.

### 2.2.2 `./dock`

Contains the *Dockerimage*, in charge of building an image from the current `develop` branch of this project

### 2.2.3 `./.vscode`

Contains files for helping with development in VS Code:

- `launch.json` Contains the debug configurations for running the project in debug
- `tasks.json` Contains tasks that can be run from VS Code that help getting the project ready for development (essentially runs `env-setup.bash`) 
- `extensions.json` Contains the recommended extensions for helping in development, which will be recommended to the user when opening the project in VS Code
- `settings.json` Contains the editor settings (paths, behaviors...)

## 2.3 Application Code

This group of directories and files contain the code of the application itself. It can be divided into two main sections:

- `src` which contains the backend code
- `templates` which contains the frontend code

Aside from those two folders. The file that runs the whole application is `app.py`, which serves a Flask API.

### 2.3.1 `src`

#### API Interfaces

This folder includes programs in charge of communicating with other external APIs:

- [**Spoonacular**](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/) is an API dedicated to nutritional information. For this project, it accomplishes two main functions:
  - Generating recipes from a list of ingredients
  - Providing details about the preparation of the recipes, as well as about the nutritional values of said recipes.
- [**LibreView**](https://www.libreview.com) is a service that helps Diabetes Patients and users of the [FreeStyle LibreLink](https://www.freestyle.abbott) sensors manage their blood glucose data.

It also includes an Interface class (`iAPI_interface`) that helps to define the base function an API interface program must have.

#### Commons

Commons is a collection of helpers that aim to centralizing some common tasks:

- `DateTiemHelper.py` implements some functions for converting from *date-time* objects to timestamp strings and vice versa, as well as performing some calculations or modifications over time-related variables
- `FileManagement.py` helps to manage file-related tasks, such as creating files, deleting, checking if a path is valid for python...
- `LoggerInitializer.py` contains a class that initializes a `logging.logger` object with the desired parameters, accounting for format or colored logging.
- `PlotlyGraphHelper.py` creates graphs in HTML from data
- `Serializable.py` is perhaps the most important of the commons, works as an abstract class or interface for defining the methods a serializable class must implement (such as converting from dictionary to an instance of said class) as well as common methods (such as serializing, deserializing or converting an object to a dictionary)

#### Db

Although it is CURRENTLY UNUSED, it consists of two programs:

- `iDatabaseCompliant`: Working as an interface for defining objects that account for being stored in a database table, such as creating a schema for creating a table for said object, inserting an object in a table, or fetching an object in a table.
- `DataBase.py` is a set of methods for initializing the database for the project.

#### Glucose Prediction

Contains the methods for initializing the predictor from the object stored in `reggressionGlucoseSimple.joblib` (a file that is not included in the current repository and will be downloaded by running a task in VS Code, `F1` > Tasks: Run Build Task > Environment Setup), and for predicting from data with that model

#### Models

Contains models for objects frequently used in this application:
- LibreView: Objects related to glucose readings and the LibreView API; help connecting to the API and converting received data into vectors or other types more useful for this application
- Spoonacular: Objects related to the Spoonacular API, such as recipes or nutritional information
- `ClientRequestModels.py`: Objects that model the client inputs to the project's API

### 2.3.2 `templates`:

Contains the files regarding the web interface

### 2.3.3 `app.py`

It is the main program of the application. It serves a Flask API and serves endpoints for interacting with the rest of the modules in the application.

## 2.4 Unit Tests

The `{root}/test` contains multiple files for debugging the application using the python `UnitTest` module

# 3. Building and running as a docker image

## 3.1 Building the image:

The image will be built (at the moment, at least) from the develop branch of this repository.

The build instructions are stored in `{root}/dock/Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# 1. Use ubuntu as base
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# 2. Install git
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    && apt-get clean

# 3. Clone the app repo
WORKDIR /app
RUN git clone -b develop https://github.com/mihaiBront/CloudComputing_FinalProject.git .

# 4. Run script to create environment for the app
RUN bash -c "source .scripts/env-setup_deploy.bash"

# 5. Expose the port
EXPOSE 5000

# 6. Command for starting the app with container
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "source .venv/bin/activate && flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000"]
```

1. Takes the latest instance of the Ubuntu Docker Image
2. Installs GIT for cloning the repository
3. Creates a directory for the application(`app`) in the root, sets it as the working directory, and clones the latest commit from the develop branch to that folder.
4. Runs the script in charge of getting all dependencies ready (in this case, since it is working from inside the repository, `.scripts/env-setup_deploy.bash`$^{*1}$)
5. Exposing the port where the application will be served
6. Setting the startup command


>$*1 \rightarrow$ The creation of a variant of the env setup script is due to the fact that the scripts that are run from the *Dockerfile* are already being run as root, and are not compatible with `sudo`

For creating the image, move to the `dock` directory:
```bash
cd dock/
```

Then, run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

## 3.2 Running the image:

Run the following script:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name <container-name> <image-name>
```

Or alternatively, if you want to run detached from the container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d --name <container-name> <image-name>
```

## 3.3 Download the latest published image from DockerHub:
link: [docker.io/glucose-prediction-cc](https://hub.docker.com/r/mihaibront/glucose-prediction-cc)

# 4. App usage

Accessing `localhost:5000` will reveal this page:

![Website Home Page](.readme/website.png)

Where:

1. **Ingredients input**: Insert the ingredients you have for generating recipes 
2. **Recipes List**: The app will suggest three recipes containing, at least, those inputted ingredients. Selecting one will turn it green, and its details will be shown in the lower-right side of the screen
3. **Glucose Graph**: Graph containing the predictions taking into account *last 24h of glucose*, the *insulin input* and the *carbs* of the recipe
4. **Insulin Input**: The doses of insulin the user intends to administrate himself
5. **Recipe Details**: Details about the selected recipe

## NOTE THAT: Required API keys are not included in the repository

Navigate to `localhost:5000` and insert the required API keys:

- *Spoonacular* (you can register)
- *LibreView* API key and account token (you can get them by accessing the service through their web and spying on requests with the inspect tool)

# 6. Developing guidelines

| Concept | Requirement        |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Python  | version>=3.12      |
| IDE     | Visual Studio Code |

## 6.1. Opening project in VS Code

1) Press `F1` to open command palette
2) Have Python 3.12.X installed
3) Search for "*Tasks: Run Build Task*" and click on it
4) Run the "*Environment Setup Task*", which will install all necessary dependencies and get the virtual environment ready
5) Press `F1` again and select interpreter as

## 6.2. Debugging with flask

1) Go to the debug pane (left bar in Visual Studio Code)
2) Find "*RUN AND DEBUG*" on the top of that pane (you will see a Play button and a *drop-down* selector)
3) In that *drop-down* selector, chose `Python Debugger: Flask ({Project Name})`
4) Run it. It will launch flask in *debug mode* with *hot reload*.

## 6.3. Notes on development
- All necessary pip installs must be added to the requirements.txt, since will be used for the container setup as well
- Changes in settings for this project must be done at "workspace" level, so they are updated to all users

## 6.4 Handling secret variables

Secret variables like API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information should be handled as follows:

- Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project
- The `.env.local` file is already added to the `.gitignore` file, so these secret variables don't get tracked.

><t style="font-size:16">***Warning!***</t></br>
>All sensitive information such as "API" keys, passwords or any login information which use is intended for testing or development should be stored inside this `env.local` file.

><t style="font-size:16">***Pending...***</t></br>
>Definition of where and how to store login information. For the purposes of this project, we will simply add them to the env file and handle them from there

# 7. Conclusion

## 7.1 Degree of application of the knowledge acquired:

The main concept from this subject (*SJK005 - Cloud Computing*) that we applied to this project is the creation of container images and the deployment of containers with Docker/Podman.

Since this specific application relates to **big-data** and **machine learning**, we also applied some concepts from the *Cloud Computing, Big Data, Al and ML0*

Unfortunately, the project didn't need the implementation of various containers nor any *container orchestration* it didn't reach the complexity.

## 7.2 Relationship with other subject in the master's degree:

We used knowledge acquired in the *SJK006 - Big Data* subject for creating the predictor model. The predictor model has been trained from a dataset taken from *Kaggle*, [brist1d - blood glucose dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/brist1d)

The model training required:
- Extensive data cleaning 

## 7.3 Future improvements
