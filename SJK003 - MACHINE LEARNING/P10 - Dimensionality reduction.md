**Objective:** btain a reduced representation of the data that is much smaller in size and make it feasible for analysis. We need this due to:
- data analysis could be too complex with huge data sets 
- data analysis could be too computational expensive with huge data sets 
- noisy instances can lead to misclassifications
- irrelevant and redundant attributes can hinder any machine learning process
