# 4.1 Intro

2D Fourier transformation
$$
I(x,y) = I(u, v)
$$
Translates a matrix into two frequencies, one for each direction
Can be used, for example, for edge detection

# 4.2 Fourier transformation
## 4.2.1 Refresh

Decomposition of a function into an infinite sum of sinusoidal functions.

![[Pasted image 20240923164734.png]]
$$
f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_ncos(nx) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_ncos(nx)
$$
Where:
- $a_0$ is the base offset over the $y$ axis
- $a_n, b_n$ are the weights of that component

$a_n, b_n$ are calculated as:
$$
a_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{+\pi}f(x)cos(nx)dx
$$
$$
n=0,1,2,3...
$$

$$
a_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{+\pi}f(x)sin(nx)dx
$$
$$
n=1,2,3,4...
$$
And the cosine and sine functions can be expressed as complex numbers like:
$$
cos(\phi) = \frac{e^{i\phi}+e^{-i\phi}}{2i}
$$
$$
cos(\phi) = \frac{e^{i\phi}-e^{-i\phi}}{2i}
$$

## 4.2.2 Discrete transformed applied to images

What happens in 2D and on an Image plain:
- An image is a "limited region" for this function, so the longest period (lowest frequency) available for each axis, is the width or height of the image.
- An image is a discrete space, so the highest frequency available 

So, the expression of the Fourier transform for a discrete system and a limited region function is:
$$
F[k,j] = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}f[n,m]e^{-2\pi i (kn/N+jm/M)}
$$

## 4.2.3 Modulation

- Magnitude (amplitude) for each harmonic
- Phase

## 4.2.4 The transform and its properties

![[Pasted image 20240923171033.png]]
Both transformations are lossless

Actually, the resulting DFT Magnitud image, would not be exactly like that, but instead, it is divided in quadrants and reordered to obtain the "Optic DFT:
![[Pasted image 20240923171740.png]]

- From the DFT Magnitude representation, we can observe that the lowest frequencies (closest to the center of the axes), are predominant. This is typical of a, so to say, "natural" image.

- The DFT Phase representation is almost always used to reconstruct the image.

## 4.2.5 DFT/FFT

- In 1D signals for N samples
	- DFT: Holds for any N value $O(N^2)$
	- FFT: Only holds for N values that are power 2 $O(Nlog(N))$ (Zero padding)

- In 2D:
	- The transform is separable; can be calculated over one whole axis and then once for the other axis
	- Transform first in one dimension and then in the other dimension
	- That is because the function is symmetric

# 4.3 Convolution theorem, the relationship between the spatial and frequential realm
#exam

*How does a convolution translates to the frequency realm?*

If we convolute an image with a kernel: $f*g=h$, it translates into a frequency-by-frequency product of $F · G = H$. In other words, the result of the convolution's Fourier transform multiplied by the image's Fourier transform.

Then, to recover the "original image but filtered", we also have to multiply the phase (actually, we multiply the complex polar form).
